I looked into the expenditures in meals while traveling, finding in 2276 transactions, a total of over $150,000 spent, but with great variance: the median was 34 dollars, but there were 3 values over 1000 (found with another script). 
All values are from the first quarter of 2017, and while most of them come from the program "Official Expenses of Members", there are 9 other programs that have spent in this category.
